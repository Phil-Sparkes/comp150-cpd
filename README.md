Weekly journal goes here. Reflect.

## Week 1

I am happy with my progress so far, I can comprehend most of the ideas that have been put forth and finding the programming tasks to be a good level of challenge.

In the Tinkering graphics sessions I teamed up with one of my peers and together we tackled the activities we managed to complete the initial Activities but with the later ones we couldn’t figure out how to read the RGB value of the pixel, instead of an RGB value we received an integer. I decided to carry on with these activities after I had returned home. Doing some tests showed that the integer displayed was related to the binary of the RGB. Using some code I found off the internet I managed to split this number into the three different values red green and blue. Once this had been achieved I finished the rest of the activities.

## Week 2

In 110 we studied computation time and provided with a worksheet to complete on the subject. It took me a while to get my head round the maths in this and I had to write a couple programs to help my understanding. In 120 we worked on the second tinkering for graphics workshop. I managed to implement most of the functions from the slides into my program and then tried experimenting on the code to see what else I could make it achieve. In 150 I presented my game pitch. I feel like I didn’t manage to explain a lot of aspects of my game or provide everyone with a clear understanding on what the game actually is. Practicing the pitch beforehand and making notes I could follow would be a good way to improve this.

## Week 3

This week in 110 we learned about class systems in python, I have used class systems previously but touched very lightly on the area. I found class systems to be a very useful tool when making programs and will try to implement them into future programs. I changed the program we are making in 150 to use class systems. In 120 we worked on the final tinkering workshop. In this session I implemented the functions from the slides and also created some new ones by changing the code and experimenting. 150 we were learning about scholarly writing and thinking and how to use LaTeX and BiBeX to format our work. On the desktop game project I had problems with trying to get the character to rotate to face the mouse and shoot paintballs towards the mouse. To find out how to make this work I will research how other people have achieved this and use similar code.

## Week 4


## Week 5

In 110 we did debugging for the worksheet we did the previous week, mine didn’t produce any bugs so I helped my colleague next to me with his. In 120 we had our first workshop on tinkering audio, I managed to get mine working with the desired output. In 150 we had out sprint review for the desktop game. It was the first session in which all the team members were present so we took the time to go over progress so far and what we plan to do in the next sprint. A problem we encountered was that the Trello board we were using was not specific enough with the user stories. To address this we will put in some time improving the user stories so everyone has a clear understanding on what each one means.
