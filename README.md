# comp150-cpd

## Week 1 - 23rd Jan

This week I took part in the global game jam this week to make a game in 48 hours, was an interesting event working with a new team and using a new engine (Unity). In the 130 session, we had our first experience programming in C++ and writing a “Hello world” program. We were also learning more about OO design which seems important for engines such as unreal. In 160 we learnt about code smells and software quality. The biggest challenge I found this week was putting forward my ideas during the game jam, would like to be able to communicate with new teams easier.
## Week 2 - 30th Jan

This week we were working more on the transition to C++ by having a look at how the syntax changes between C++ and python. In 140 we were also looking into syntax such as list and vectors and how to use them in the unreal engine. We were having problems with getting a C++ unreal project working on the studio computers. In 160 we were exploring the use of UML and class diagrams. I found creating these diagrams to be a challenge because I am still not sure what they are used and how they help.

## Week 3 - 6th Feb

In 130 this week we covered more on the topic of object orientated design looking at inheritance and the get/set functions. I would like to use these techniques in my programs as much as possible. The 140 we had a workshop on unreal but found this not to be so helpful seeing as the C++ wasn’t working still in the studio so had to use blueprints instead. I found completing the tasks in this workshop a challenge this week as it was a lot of research to achieve some simple functionality.

## Week 4 - 13th Feb

This week we were further examining games engines and how to utilize them, looking at the main loop, frame rate and time steps. In 140 we looked at memory stack and heap and when to use which. The 160 session was cancelled this week and instead we were told to come up with our essay question. The biggest challenge I had this week was thinking of a good question for the software engineering essay. Had a look at a lot of academic papers but still finding it hard to come up with a good essay question. During the weekend, I volunteered for the girl guiding event, was interesting to see how well young girls could use software and what kind of software they were using.

## Week 5 - 20th Feb

For 130 this week we had a guest lecture on computational creativity. I found a lot of the topics discussed in this lecture to be very interesting. Especially neural networks and genetic algorithms. As a personal project, I would like to be able to create a basic neural network. In the 140 workshop, we were learning about how to do save states, checkpoints and serialization which could come in useful for our game project. 

## Week 6 - 27th Feb

This week we had two guest lectures, the first being on using algorithms in physics to create realistic game physics. This lecture had lots of interesting physics simulations showing how code could be used to replicate real physics. I feel like a lot of the code would not work so well on games though as games need to be able to real time render when some of these simulations took weeks to render. The second lecture was from an industry veteran in which he told us a lot about working in the industry and what it is like. Lots of what he said contradicted things we have been taught which was amusing. In 140 we had an Arduino workshop, creating simple circuit boards with the Arduino and coding in functionality. I found understanding how the circuitry worked to be a bit challenging and would like to look further into it.
