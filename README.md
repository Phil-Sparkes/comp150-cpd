# comp160-cpd

## Week 1 - 23rd Jan

This week I took part in the global game jam this week to make a game in 48 hours, was an interesting event working with a new team and using a new engine (Unity). In the 130 session, we had our first experience programming in C++ and writing a “Hello world” program. We were also learning more about OO design which seems important for engines such as unreal. In 160 we learnt about code smells and software quality. The biggest challenge I found this week was putting forward my ideas during the game jam, would like to be able to communicate with new teams easier.
## Week 2 - 30th Jan

This week we were working more on the transition to C++ by having a look at how the syntax changes between C++ and python. In 140 we were also looking into syntax such as list and vectors and how to use them in the unreal engine. We were having problems with getting a C++ unreal project working on the studio computers. In 160 we were exploring the use of UML and class diagrams. I found creating these diagrams to be a challenge because I am still not sure what they are used and how they help.

## Week 3 - 6th Feb

In 130 this week we covered more on the topic of object orientated design looking at inheritance and the get/set functions. I would like to use these techniques in my programs as much as possible. The 140 we had a workshop on unreal but found this not to be so helpful seeing as the C++ wasn’t working still in the studio so had to use blueprints instead. I found completing the tasks in this workshop a challenge this week as it was a lot of research to achieve some simple functionality.

## Week 4 - 13th Feb

This week we were further examining games engines and how to utilize them, looking at the main loop, frame rate and time steps. In 140 we looked at memory stack and heap and when to use which. The 160 session was cancelled this week and instead we were told to come up with our essay question. The biggest challenge I had this week was thinking of a good question for the software engineering essay. Had a look at a lot of academic papers but still finding it hard to come up with a good essay question. During the weekend, I volunteered for the girl guiding event, was interesting to see how well young girls could use software and what kind of software they were using.

## Week 5 - 20th Feb

For 130 this week we had a guest lecture on computational creativity. I found a lot of the topics discussed in this lecture to be very interesting. Especially neural networks and genetic algorithms. As a personal project, I would like to be able to create a basic neural network. In the 140 workshop, we were learning about how to do save states, checkpoints and serialization which could come in useful for our game project. 

## Week 6 - 27th Feb

This week we had two guest lectures, the first being on using algorithms in physics to create realistic game physics. This lecture had lots of interesting physics simulations showing how code could be used to replicate real physics. I feel like a lot of the code would not work so well on games though as games need to be able to real time render when some of these simulations took weeks to render. The second lecture was from an industry veteran in which he told us a lot about working in the industry and what it is like. Lots of what he said contradicted things we have been taught which was amusing. In 140 we had an Arduino workshop, creating simple circuit boards with the Arduino and coding in functionality. I found understanding how the circuitry worked to be a bit challenging and would like to look further into it.

## Week 8 - 13th Mar



# Career goals and progress
My career goal is to work in the computer industry preferably in something that could hold my interest like developing games. During my time at university I have made progress towards this goal. Learning how to program on both python and C++. Outside of the curriculum I have been working on my own game projects making a 3D fighter pilot game to improve my skills in unreal and other aspects of game development. I have also been collaborating with a business student taking the role of chief technology officer and doing some programming for him. I have been putting together a portfolio with all my past work in so that it can easily show case my skills to future employers.


# Five challenges


## Communication with new people
A challenge I found during the ideation stage of the big game project and during the game jam is being able to communicate my ideas when with a group of new people. To improve team communication skill next project, I will make sure that I put forward at least two ideas. 


## Benefits of C++ when using unreal
Something that I found this year was that during the project I was mostly using blueprints. I would like to use C++ more while using the unreal engine but not sure what the benefits are using it over blueprints. I am working on a side project over summer making an unreal game. I will try and add as much C++ functionality to this as possible. After the project, I will do a review and see which parts of the C++ code benefited the project over using blueprints.


## Not knowing hand in dates for drafts
Another challenge I encountered this year was discovering that I had hand in dates for drafts too close to the actual hand in. I would like to know when these hand in dates are before it gets too late. My plan to combat this is to go through my modules looking at what is happening in the next sessions. Once I know this I will put it on my calendar. I will measure the success of this throughout the year, if I am aware of all hand in dates at least a week before it’s due then I will consider it a success.


## Attending stand up meetings
I have missed some of the daily stand-up meetings this year for our group project. This is in part due to not knowing when they are. I plan to address this for the next project by putting the times on my google calendar that I have on my phone so I can easily see when I have them. I will do a review after the first few weeks to check if it working as planned.


## Essay questions
During this course we are required to write academic essays, these essays require us to come up with our own question. Being able to propose a good essay question will make writing the essay much simpler. To be able to devise a good question I will do research on how others manage to produce them. This will be online research looking at articles and pages providing ideas on how to come up with a question. I will do this over summer and practice making three essay questions for different topics. To measure this, I will ask someone in academia to access my questions and give me feedback.
