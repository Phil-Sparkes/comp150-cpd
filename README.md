## Week 1

Weekly journal goes here. Reflect.

I am happy with my progress so far, I can comprehend most of the ideas that have been put forth and finding the programming tasks to be a good level of challenge.

In the Tinkering graphics sessions I teamed up with one of my peers and together we tackled the activities we managed to complete the initial Activities but with the later ones we couldnâ€™t figure out how to read the RGB value of the pixel, instead of an RGB value we received an integer. I decided to carry on with these activities after I had returned home. Doing some tests showed that the integer displayed was related to the binary of the RGB. Using some code I found off the internet I managed to split this number into the three different values red green and blue. Once this had been achieved I finished the rest of the activities.

My SMART target this week is to learn how to create functions in python. I feel like this skill will be useful for making my programs more efficient.
