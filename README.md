# comp150-cpd

Weekly journal goes here. Reflect.

## Week 4

I am happy with my progress so far, I can comprehend most of the ideas that have been put forth and finding the programming tasks to be a good level of challenge.

In the Tinkering graphics sessions I teamed up with one of my peers and together we tackled the activities we managed to complete the initial Activities but with the later ones we couldn’t figure out how to read the RGB value of the pixel, instead of an RGB value we received an integer. I decided to carry on with these activities after I had returned home. Doing some tests showed that the integer displayed was related to the binary of the RGB. Using some code I found off the internet I managed to split this number into the three different values red green and blue. Once this had been achieved I finished the rest of the activities.

## Week 5

In 110 we studied computation time and provided with a worksheet to complete on the subject. It took me a while to get my head round the maths in this and I had to write a couple programs to help my understanding. In 120 we worked on the second tinkering for graphics workshop. I managed to implement most of the functions from the slides into my program and then tried experimenting on the code to see what else I could make it achieve. In 150 I presented my game pitch. I feel like I didn’t manage to explain a lot of aspects of my game or provide everyone with a clear understanding on what the game actually is. Practicing the pitch beforehand and making notes I could follow would be a good way to improve this.

## Week 6

This week in 110 we learned about class systems in python, I have used class systems previously but touched very lightly on the area. I found class systems to be a very useful tool when making programs and will try to implement them into future programs. I changed the program we are making in 150 to use class systems. In 120 we worked on the final tinkering workshop. In this session I implemented the functions from the slides and also created some new ones by changing the code and experimenting. 150 we were learning about scholarly writing and thinking and how to use LaTeX and BiBeX to format our work. On the desktop game project I had problems with trying to get the character to rotate to face the mouse and shoot paintballs towards the mouse. To find out how to make this work I will research how other people have achieved this and use similar code.

## Week 7

In 110 we studied class systems and use of dictionaries, we were also assigned Worksheet D that required us to make a noughts and crosses game using the skeleton program we were given. I managed to do this quite quickly and made a pull request. The feedback that was given showed how I could better my program. I took this into account and improved the code. The 120 session was a peer review on our tinkering graphics projects, together with a colleague we checked other groups code and commented ways to improve and fix the code. We also received feedback on our own code which we used to make adjustments to our program.   A problem this week was the stand-up meetings in slack, some didn’t take place at all and some had absent members. To address this I will make a timetable so everyone knows when the stand-up meeting are to take place.

## Week 8

In 110 we did debugging for the worksheet we did the previous week, mine didn’t produce any bugs so I helped my colleague next to me with his. In 120 we had our first workshop on tinkering audio, I managed to get mine working with the desired output. In 150 we had out sprint review for the desktop game. It was the first session in which all the team members were present so we took the time to go over progress so far and what we plan to do in the next sprint. A problem we encountered was that the Trello board we were using was not specific enough with the user stories. To address this we will put in some time improving the user stories so everyone has a clear understanding on what each one means.

## Week 9

This week we did the final worksheet for comp 110. The tasks on the worksheet were to do with assembly language and converting to python code. The most difficult part of this worksheet was to find an assembler for the final question. It took a few tries to find an assembler that worked. In the tinkering audio session we moved onto the second worksheet this one was about creating a pure tone. I am finding working with sound much more of a challenge than other tasks especially pure tones. I will work further at home to try and understand how to get pure tones to work. In the game project we introduced Travis to our github folders. My team could not get Travis to work at all. Further research into Travis is needed to be able to use this tool.

## Week 10

This week we had the final tinkering audio workshop, in this session my college and I managed to implement an envelope function into our code. The envelope function produced a bug that made it so when shifting between attack and sustain time it would start the sound wave from 0 again causing a glitch in the music and an unpleasant sound. I managed to fix this when I got home by putting the attack and sustain times in the same for loop. For 150 we were conducting peer reviews on agile essays. I had a problem with my essay in which the references would not show up. To fix this I got the help of one of my peers and asked how he managed it and then did the same for my essay.

## Week 11

In the mathematics of computing lecture I found some of the syntax hard to follow with how addresses work, for the first time I got one of the socrative questions wrong. I feel like I would be able to understand these concepts a lot easier while writing the code myself. So I plan to write the code myself to gain an understanding of how it works and when it could be useful. Our final sprint review we noticed that a lot of work still needed to be done and we needed to get our presentations ready. Time management was a big problem with this project so we had to put in a lot of last minute work over the weekend to get the game and presentation up to scratch. 

## Week 12

A problem that the viva sessions pulled up is my college not doing enough of the programming for the programming projects even during pair programming sessions it was me feeding them the code. After the viva session we decided to conduct some more pair programming on adding a decay function to our envelope but without me just telling them exactly what to write. I found it difficult to explain to my college how the code worked in a way he would understand, but after two hours we managed to complete the segment of code. This week we also had to present our game pitches, I feel like when I am presenting I speak too fast and need to take more time talking over and explaining the points in greater detail. Also I found myself reading from the slide which isn’t the best practice for pitching. To improve this I will have to practice my pitching and presentation skills.



## Summary


## Five key skills

### •	Explaining code to others
For programming practices it is a key skill to be able to explain how your code works to others in a way that they can understand. Being able to explain how your program works to fellow programmers will mean that they can maintain the code as well. This can be done by use of well-constructed comments or face to face communication. I feel like this skill with help me especially because I have been in situations where I have had to explain my code and struggled to do it in a way that the other person could understand. Without my colleges knowing how the code works they cannot add to the code or maintain the code. This effected some of my work when working in teams as I was the only one able to do the programming. To overcome this I have decided to improve my teaching skills, being able to teach someone how to code will make it so they can get an understanding of what my code is doing. I plan to do this over the Christmas break offering to teach someone how to make a basic game on python in a week course for free. After I would like to show them some code that I have done and see if I can explain it in a way they would understand and ask for feedback on the comments.
### •	Time management
Being able to manage your time with professional game development is a must. Keeping to schedule and making sure all the features are implemented on time. Some of my work had to completed the night before it was due in thus making it rushed and not to the quality I wanted it to be. An action I am taking to try and prevent this from happening again will be to schedule when I work on which module while doing at least nine hours every week. To make this time bound I have decided to test it during the first two weeks back so I can review the schedule and see what effect it has on my workload. I plan to keep this going after the two weeks so that I am not rushing my work last minute.
### •	Efficient coding practices
When developing games following efficient coding practices is a must as it leads to easier maintainability and faster computing times. I feel like most of the code I have done could be improved in some fashion to be more efficient. I want to learn how to code in the most efficient way to better my programming skills leading to better programs. I feel like practice is the best way to do this but also learning from others. I have decided to read the book “clean code” over the Christmas break to gain a better understanding of good programming practice. I plan to implement what I have learnt from this book into future programs that I will write.
### •	Presenting pitches
Another key skill in the games industry is the ability to pitch game ideas to investors. Being able to successfully pitch game concepts to developers will mean that you are more likely to receive investment. During the course so far we have had to do a number of pitches in which I am not completely satisfied with my performance. I feel like this is one of the skills that I need to improve.
I plan to video myself pitching a game idea and then watch it back and review the quality of the pitch, what I have done well and what I have done not so well. I will take this information and then incorporate it into the next pitch. I will do one video every day for a week hopefully improving my pitching skills.
### •	Using Github (Travis and branching)
Github or similar version control systems are widely used in game and software development. Knowing how to get the most out of it would be a useful skill to have. During my groups game development project we tried to incorporate “Travis” into our Github repository so it could run test scripts to check for bugs. We never managed to get it working correctly so ended up not using it. I am interested to see what it can be used for so I want to implement it successfully. Another feature of Github is branching, during the game project I mostly worked on the master branch which is bad practice. Learning how to make effective use of the branching system would be a key skill. To learn these skills I will be looking at documentation and tutorials on how to get these features working during the first two weeks back. I will consider it a success when I manage to get both Travis and the branching working correctly.
